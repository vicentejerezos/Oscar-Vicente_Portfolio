      <description>Semi-supervised Learning and Classification Model.
  Dealt with high imbalanced dataset.
  Created a tool that identifies, using a Dataset provided with transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, fraudulent credit card transactions.
  There are three Resampling Techniques:
 Under sample majority class. Over sample minority class. Generate synthetic samples (SMOTE).    Used Under sampling and Over sampling to deal with class imbalance in this project.</description>

      <title>Project III: Walmart - Store Sales Forecasting</title>

      <description>Supervised Learning and Regression Model.
  Created a tool that predicts, using a Dataset provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions, the weekly sales of each store.
  Analyzed correlation between price and every and each one of the features.
  Dealt with skewed data.
  Handled negative data values while reducing high skewness.
  Came up with an effective solution, u = log(y + 1 - min(y)), to convert them into positive when transforming skewed data.</description>

      <description>Supervised Learning and Regression Model.
  Created a tool that predicts, based on 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residencial homes in Ames, Lowa, the final price of each home.
  Analyzed correlation between price and every and each one of the features.
  Dealt with skewed data.
  Used Machine Learning Algorithms such as:
 Linear Regresssion. Decision Tree Regressor. Random Forest Regressor.</description>

      <description>Supervised Learning and Classification Model.
  Created a tool that predicts, based on some features, which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
  Answered important questions such as:
 How many survived? Was gender an important factor? Was the class important? Was age important? Was &amp;ldquo;Women and children first&amp;rdquo; a true story? What happened to the Captain?    Used Machile Learning Algorithms such as:
 Logistic Regression.</description>
